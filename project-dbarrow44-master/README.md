General Info - Zack Starrett, Dustin Barrow

Our projects were completely different so we decided to just extend the dog park application.

Stage 4 Info - We decided that the map shouldnt really be on the landing page so we moved it to the park meetup page. From there you can enter info into the form and have it stored and displayed on the other side of the map. We both got on and worked on everything throughout discord calls. 

Dustin - Did a lot of the conversion to angular for the basic pages. Worked on the routing and placing components in the right place. Got the map halfway working then Zack came in and nailed it. Helped get the tik-tok video mostly working. 

Zack - Worked on figuring out how to convert the map into an angular version and revised the functionality. Placed the interactable tik-tok video into the langing page so the user can expand to see it or hide it. Revised some css and html for both.
