                        You can check-in in real time as you arrive at the park or simply mark it on the calender when and where you and your furry friend will be.

                        Thats where you come in. Keep track of when your last vet vist was or what time to administer medicine. This amazing dog fact might answer a long-standing question that dog owners have. 
                        Why are dogs noses wet? Vetstreet says that the answer is that dogâ€™s noses are wet to help them absorb scent chemicals! 
                        Their nose secretes a special mucus that helps to absorb these chemicals, and then they lick their noses to sample them, helping them understand what the smell is.
