        <h2>Application Information</h2>
        <p>
            This application will be designed to allow users to generate a shopping list for a suggested meal idea based on a search term.
        </p>
        <p>
            This app uses the Edamam API to search a database of meal ideas and present a randomly selected meal item,
             along with a corresponding image, ingredient list, and health information based on a search term.

             Visit the 'Search' page to try it out!

        <h2>Future Ideas</h2>
        <p><img class="inlineimg" src="img/bowls.jpg" alt="Food Bowls">In the future I would like to implement a way for users to share custom shopping lists for a meal they have generated. Additionally I
            would like to use an API to access a database server containing recipe and ingredient breakdown information, including calories, nutrients, etc.
            to deliver a more complete experience to the user.

        <h2>Additional Potential Apps</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Meal Suggester</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The purpose of this app would be to suggest a meal given a specific set of ingredients from the user</li>
            <li>It would function somewhat similarly to <a href="https://www.readyseteat.com/recipe-ideas/dinner">ReadySetEat</a>, in which a main course is selected by the user.</li>
            <li>This app would take into consideration the proper balance of the meal as a whole, and provide nutrient and calorie information for the meal.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Ingredient Picker</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This app would help the user stock their fridge and pantry with healthy ingredients used in many recipes, and provide basic ideas for those ingredients.</li>
            <li>It would function somewhat similarly to <a href="https://whisk.com/">Whisk</a>, an app that breaks down recipes into shopping lists, except in reverse.</li>
            <li>This app would suggest commonly used ingredients to the user, and based on their selections will provide healhy meal ideas.</li>
        </ul>
